\par
MAD-X is a general-purpose tool for charged-particle optics design and studies in alternating-gradient accelerators and beam lines. It can handle medium size to very large accelerators and solves various problems on such machines. MAD-X is the successor of MAD-8 and was specially adapted to the needs of the design of the LHC. The PTC library of E. Forest was also embedded in MAD-X as an addition to better support small and low energy accelerators. 
\par
This document outlines the physical models used in MAD-X. It should help the physicist in understanding the precise function of the program, and appreciate possible limits of validity.
